# Coffee-Shop-Sales-Analysis

# **Problem Statement**
Organizations often struggle to analyze and monitor key business metrics such as sales, orders, and quantities sold over time. Without effective tools, it becomes challenging to track month-over-month trends, identify performance variations, and derive actionable insights. Additionally, understanding sales patterns across weekdays, weekends, and store locations requires dynamic and interactive visualizations to support data-driven decision-making. The lack of these capabilities hinders efforts to optimize performance and respond proactively to changing business needs.

 # **Project Objective:**
The objective of this project is to design and develop a comprehensive data analytics solution that enables businesses to:
 - Analyze and track monthly key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, total orders, and total quantity sold.
 - Identify trends and month-over-month changes to support data-driven decision-making.
 - Provide dynamic and interactive visualizations, including calendar heatmaps, weekday/weekend performance comparisons, and sales analysis by store locations.
 -  Deliver actionable insights to optimize business strategies and improve overall performance.
This project focuses on creating an end-to-end data analytics dashboard that empowers organizations to gain a deeper understanding of their performance metrics. The dashboard will provide:

**KPI Analysis:**
- Calculation of total sales, orders, and quantity sold for each month.
- Month-over-month comparisons to highlight increases or decreases in metrics.
- Detailed insights into changes between the selected month and the previous month.

**Interactive Visualizations:**
- A calendar heatmap that dynamically adjusts based on the selected month, highlighting sales trends by day with tooltips displaying detailed metrics (sales, orders, and quantity).
  
- Segmentation of sales performance by weekdays and weekends to analyze behavioral patterns.
 
- Visualization of sales trends by store locations, including month-over-month differences to identify high- and low-performing locations.
  
By combining KPI analysis with dynamic and actionable visualizations, the project aims to enable businesses to uncover hidden trends, monitor their performance effectively, and make data-driven decisions to enhance operations and profitability.

# **Dataset Overview**

•	Duration: The data spans six months, from January 2023 to June 2023.
Dataset Size
•	Total Records: 149,116 rows, indicating a robust dataset with extensive transaction details.

•	Number of Attributes: 10 columns, each contributing valuable insights into different aspects of the transactions.

•	Transaction ID: A unique code assigned to each transaction.

•	Transaction Date: The specific day when the transaction took place.

•	Transaction Time: The exact time the transaction occurred, allowing for time-based analysis.

•	Transaction Quantity: The number of items purchased in a transaction.

•	Unit Price: The price of a single item in the transaction.

•	Product ID: A unique identifier for each product.

•	Product Category: A broader grouping of products (e.g., apparel, electronics).

•	Product Type: A more specific sub-group within a category.

•	Product Detail: Additional information about the product, such as the brand or size.

•	Store ID: A unique code assigned to each store.

•	Store Location: The geographical location of the store (e.g., city or region).

# **Data modeling**

In this project, I designed and implemented a data model in Power BI that enhances sales analysis through the integration of a Date Table. This involved creating a custom Date Table and building relationships between it and the transactional data for advanced time-based insights.
Steps Taken:

1.	Creation of Date Table:
o	I manually created a new Date Table to ensure comprehensive time-based analysis. The Date Table includes the following columns:
-Year
- Month
- Day
- Day of the Week
- Weekday/weekend
- Month year
 
# **DAX( (Data Analysis Expressions)**

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) was used in this project to calculate key metrics like total sales, average transactions, and category-wise performance, enabling dynamic and actionable insights through Power BI visualizations.

Sales = 'Transactions'[unit_price] * 'Transactions'[transaction_qty]

Total Sales = sum('Transactions'[Sales])

Total Orders = DISTINCTCOUNT('Transactions'[transaction_id])

Total Quantity sold = sum(Transactions[transaction_qty])

CM Orders = VAR selected_month = SELECTEDVALUE('Date table'[Month])Return TOTALMTD (CALCULATE ([Total Orders],'Date table'[Month] = selected_month),'Date table'[Date])

CM Quantity = VAR selected_month = SELECTEDVALUE('Date table'[Month]) Return TOTALMTD(CALCULATE([Total Quantity sold],'Date table'[Month] = selected_month),'Date table'[Date])

CM Sale = VAR selected_month = SELECTEDVALUE('Date table'[Month]) Return 
  TOTALMTD(CALCULATE([Total Sales],'Date table'[Month] = selected_month),'Date table'[Date])

MoM Growth & Diff Quantity = 
Var month_diff = [CM Quantity]- [PM Quantity]
var mom = ([CM Quantity] -[PM Quantity])/[PM Quantity]
var _sign = IF(month_diff >0, "+", "")
VAR _sign_trend = IF(month_diff>0, "▲","▼" )
Return  _sign_trend & " " & _sign & FORMAT(mom, "#0.0%" & " | " & _sign &   format(month_diff/1000,"0.0K"))& " " & "vs LM"

# **Recommendations**

**Focus on High-Performing Products:**
   
- Increase promotion of top products like Coffee, Tea, Barista Espresso, and Hot Chocolate through discounts, bundles, or loyalty programs to maintain momentum.

- Introduce seasonal or limited-time offers in the Bakery category to boost sales further.

**Boost Weekend Sales:**
   
- Develop weekend-specific promotions (e.g., "Weekend Happy Hours" or special combos) to drive more traffic during this slower period.

- Partner with local events to attract customers on weekends.

**Optimize Store Operations:**
   
- Hell’s Kitchen is a strong performer, but other locations like Astoria and Lower Manhattan show equally promising growth. Consider replicating successful strategies from Hell’s Kitchen in these areas.

- Staff peak hours (7AM– 12 PM) with additional resources to handle high demand efficiently.

**Targeted Marketing Campaigns:**

- Since weekdays drive most sales, focus digital advertising and email campaigns during those days.

- Utilize customer insights (from loyalty programs or surveys) to tailor product recommendations and upsell strategies.

**Introduce Evening Offerings:**
   
- With lower sales during evening hours, consider introducing special evening-themed beverages or snacks, such as herbal teas, desserts, or discounted coffee.

**Refine Data Analysis:**

- Drill down into customer preferences by combining product sales with customer demographics.

- Analyze specific reasons for the Sunday sales dip and target this day with a unique promotion (e.g., family discounts or kids’ menus).
