# **Problem Statement**
Organizations often struggle to analyze and monitor key business metrics such as sales, orders, and quantities sold over time. Without effective tools, it becomes challenging to track month-over-month trends, identify performance variations, and derive actionable insights. Additionally, understanding sales patterns across weekdays, weekends, and store locations requires dynamic and interactive visualizations to support data-driven decision-making. The lack of these capabilities hinders efforts to optimize performance and respond proactively to changing business needs.

This project aims to address these challenges by implementing comprehensive KPI analysis and interactive visualizations, enabling businesses to:
- Calculate and track key performance indicators (KPIs) for total sales, orders, and quantities sold across months.
- Identify month-over-month trends and differences in performance metrics.
- Leverage dynamic charts, such as calendar heatmaps and sales segmentations by weekdays, weekends, and store locations, to uncover patterns and enhance decision-making.

 # **Project Objective:**
The objective of this project is to design and develop a comprehensive data analytics solution that enables businesses to:
 - Analyze and track monthly key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, total orders, and total quantity sold.
 - Identify trends and month-over-month changes to support data-driven decision-making.
 - Provide dynamic and interactive visualizations, including calendar heatmaps, weekday/weekend performance comparisons, and sales analysis by store locations.
 -  Deliver actionable insights to optimize business strategies and improve overall performance.

# **Overview:**
This project focuses on creating an end-to-end data analytics dashboard that empowers organizations to gain a deeper understanding of their performance metrics. The dashboard will provide:

**KPI Analysis:**
- Calculation of total sales, orders, and quantity sold for each month.
- Month-over-month comparisons to highlight increases or decreases in metrics.
- Detailed insights into changes between the selected month and the previous month.

**Interactive Visualizations:**
- A calendar heatmap that dynamically adjusts based on the selected month, highlighting sales trends by day with tooltips displaying detailed metrics (sales, orders, and quantity).
- Segmentation of sales performance by weekdays and weekends to analyze behavioral patterns.
- Visualization of sales trends by store locations, including month-over-month differences to identify high- and low-performing locations.
By combining KPI analysis with dynamic and actionable visualizations, the project aims to enable businesses to uncover hidden trends, monitor their performance effectively, and make data-driven decisions to enhance operations and profitability.
